## 🤝 · Contributing

You can contribute but it may take an indefinite amount of time for me to review and merge it as I have a lot of other stuff as well. Pull requests won't be accepted if its only a:

- Code refactor
- Useless change
- Contains NSFW content
- Decreases site accessibility
- Variable, class, id, etc. name change
